In the following, a 2D spatially-selective excitation experiment
[Pauly 1989] will be demontrated in detail in three different
ways. The first will reflect the flexibility of the symbolic
mathematics evaluation capabilities of JEMRIS. In the second part, the
use and implementation of external gradient and RF pulses will be
demonstrated, and in a third part, the framework will be extended to
boost the performance of the simulation process.

\li Start the sequence GUI.
\li From the \c <b>File</b> menu select \c <b>Open sequence</b>.
\li Select the sequence file created in the first steps tutorial: \c <b>MyEPI.xml</b>.
\li To not overwrite MyEPI, save it as \c <b>PaulyEtAl.xml</b>

The paper describes the spatially-selective small tip
angle excitation with the application of two gradients accompanied by
an RF pulse.

To start off, let us delete the hard rf pulse and replace it with a 2D selective excitation block consisting of an analytic RF pulse, and two analytic gradient pulses in read and phase direction.

\li Click on the rubber gum in the on the module bar and click on 
\li Choose an analytic RF pulse from the module menue and \c <b>HRF</b>.
\li Click in the moldule bar on the symbol for an analytic RF pulse add it to \c <b>Exc</b>.
\li Rename it to \c <b>ERF</b>, for excitation RF pulse.
\li Add two analytic gradient pulses to \c <b>Exc</b> by clicking on
the corresponding modul symbol and afterwards on \c <b>Exc</b>.
\li Call the first \c <b>EGX</b> for analytic gradient on the X axis.
\li Call the second \c <b>EGY</b> for analytic gradient on the Y axis.
\li Set the \c <b>Axis</b> of the latter to \c <b>GY</b>.

Let us now have a look at the analytical solution for the rf pulse and
the k-space trajectory presented by the author, which we want to
implement:

The paper investigates the case where beta is 2, n is 8, and A is 1
while the excitation is played out for 2 ms. The following steps will
associate the excitation block to the according formulas.

\li Click on \c <b>ERF</b>.
\li Set \c <b>Duration</b> to 2.
\li Set \c <b>Observe</b> to \c <b>ERF,Duration</b>.

What the last step essentially means, is that some attribute of RF
pulse needs to know about its own duration. You can see,
the magnitude of the RF pulse is time dependent and varies over the 2
ms pulse duration. The concept of observing oneselfs attribute may
appear confusing on a first glance, but is due to the flexibility of
the attribute implmentation. 

Let us now type in the constants involved in order of apearance. They
can be accessed by depending attributes as \c <b>c1</b> through
\c <b>c5</b>.

\li Type \c <b>1,.01,1,2,8</b> for gamma, alpha, A, beta, and n. 

Here, some explanation is needed as to why gamma is set to 1.  Simply
put, JEMRIS does not simulate the nuclear physics deeper than to the
point, where the relaxation times for proton imaging are given. In
that case the field strength dependant part is intrinsically built
into the sample. So, in order to simulate the effects associated with
faster T2 decay at high fields, one changes the value for T2
accordingly. 

Let us now type in the formula of the time dependant rf magnitude.

\li Set \c <b>Shape</b> to \c <b>c1*c2*c3/a1*exp( -c4^2 * (1-T/a1)^2) *
  ((2*Pi*c5*(1-T/a1))^2 + 1)^0.5</b>.
\li Set \c <b>TPOIs</b> to \c <b>200</b>.

You should now be looking at the GUI in the following state:

We are not finished yet. The Gradients are next.

\li Click on \c <b>EGX</b>.

We need to introduce the necessary parameters, all stemming from
\c <b>ERF</b>. As there are the duration, A, and n.

\li Set \c <b>Observe</b> to
\c <b>ERF,Duration/ERF,Constant3/ERF,Constant5</b>.
\li Set \c <b>Duration</b> to \c <b>a1</b>.
\li Set \c <b>Shape</b> to \c <b>a2*(1-T/a1)*cos(2*Pi*a3*T/a1)</b>.
\li Set \c <b>Diff</b> to 1.
\li Click on \c <b>EGY</b>.
\li Set \c <b>Duration</b> to \c <b>a1</b>.
\li Set \c <b>Shape</b> to \c <b>a2*(1-T/a1)*sin(2*Pi*a3*T/a1)</b>.
\li Set \c <b>Diff</b> to 1.

The not obvious step in the last instruction block is the setting of
the value for \c <b>Diff</b>. In this step, the flexibility of the
symbolic math library is demonstrated. The formula, that was typed in
for the \c <b>Shape</b> describes the k-space trajectory's time
evolution. However, we are interested in the shape of the
corresponding gradient. Which is just the first derivative with
respect to time or \c <b>T</b>. Alternatively you may also reset Diff
to 0 and set \c <b>Shape</b> to the formula for the gradients as
described in the paper:

It is easily comprehendable that the differentiation will cost
simulation time.

In Part 2, we will expand the framework by two very easily coded
classes to demonstrate the extensibility of the
framework. Additionally, as the use of symbolic mathematics is very
appealing and should be the first choice for implementing new ideas,
there are some performance issues to be considered. If, however, the
computation is shifted to the level of the framework in C++, major
speed ups may be gained depending on the complexity of the mathematics
involved. 

You may now simulate the sequence as described in the first steps
tutorial. But! be very careful here. The simulation involves some
computation power and, depending on the sample size, some RAM.
